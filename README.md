# WaterDog_DiscordBot
A fun side project made for my significant other. This is a discord bot that utilizes calls to 'http://results.dogpile.com' to collect images and display them to the user. The application is meant for Discord's Bot integration and runs on Discord's web, mobile, and desktop applications. The application itself runs on Heroku.
